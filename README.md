# 📚 LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository!  
Here I upload my solutions **pattern‑wise** to keep them organized and easy to navigate.

## 📂 Folder Structure

| 📁 Folder | 📌 Pattern Description |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `array` | Problems related to arrays |
| `string` | Problems related to strings |
| `stack` | Problems solved using stack techniques |
| `queue` | Problems solved using queue techniques |
| `linked-list` | Linked List related problems |
| `dp` | Dynamic Programming problems |
| `binary-tree` | Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree problems |

*(You can add or modify folders as you continue.)*

## ✅ How to use this repo
1. Go into the folder of the pattern you want (e.g., `stack/`).
2. Each file is named according to the problem title.
3. Solutions are mostly in **Java** (or whichever language you prefer).

## ✨ Example

**Stack Folder (`stack/`):**
- `valid-parentheses.java`
- `min-stack.java`
- `daily-temperatures.java`

**Array Folder (`array/`):**
- `two-sum.java`
- `maximum-subarray.java`

## 💡 Why pattern-wise?
Organizing problems by pattern makes revision and learning much easier.  
When you want to revise **stack problems**, you can directly go to the `stack` folder.
